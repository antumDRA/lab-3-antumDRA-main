# Lab 3 String Practice

In today's lab, we will practice using different String functions to get more comfortable with strings. The outline of the program has been created for you, you only need to add your code between the conditional statements and in the right spaces.

## Problems

- Palindrome : Print true or false if the given string is a palindrome
- Expanding a string : Create a string that repeats N times, where N is given in by the user
- String Occurrence: Given a string and a substring, find how many times the substring appears in the string
- Vowel occurrence : Given a string, count and output how many vowels are in the string.
